üè† Property Letting Web Application
üìñ Overview
This full-stack Property Letting Web Application was developed as part of my Server-Side Web Development coursework. The project demonstrates my ability to build a complete CRUD-based web solution using Next.js, Node.js, and MySQL, with secure authentication, database integration, and role-based access control for multiple user types.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
   ‚Ä¢	Three User Roles
        o	Admin: Manage users and applications; approve or decline property requests.
        o	Landlord: Add, edit, view, and delete their property listings; manage tenant applications.
        o	Tenant: Browse available properties, apply to rent, and track the status of applications
   ‚Ä¢	Authentication & Security
        o	Login and registration for all roles with password hashing using bcrypt.
        o	Session and cookie handling for secure sign-in and sign-out operations.
   ‚Ä¢	Database Design (MySQL)
        o	users table ‚Äì stores landlords, tenants, and admins with role identifiers.
        o	properties table ‚Äì stores property listings linked to landlords.
        o	applications table ‚Äì manages tenant applications and approval statuses.
        o	Implements foreign key relationships with ON DELETE CASCADE for relational integrity.
   ‚Ä¢	Core Functionality
        o	Full CRUD operations for property and user management.
        o	Dynamic Apply Now and My Applications views for tenants.
        o	Instant status updates across all roles (admin, landlord, tenant).
        o	Confirmation prompts before deletion (via cookies).
        o	Role-based dashboards with intuitive navigation.
   ‚Ä¢	Frontend & User Experience
        o	Clean, responsive design with hover effects for listed properties.
        o	Navigation bar linking to Home, Browse Properties, Register, and Login pages.
        o	Screenshots display smooth navigation and interactive components.
   ‚Ä¢	Data & Hosting
        o	Database created and tested using SQL scripts inside Visual Studio Code.
        o	Images sourced from daft.ie for academic demonstration only.

üß© Technical Stack
‚Ä¢	Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Next.js (React framework)
‚Ä¢	Backend: Node.js, Express.js
‚Ä¢	Database: MySQL (Relational database with normalized schema)
‚Ä¢	Security: bcrypt password hashing, cookie-based session management
‚Ä¢	Version Control: Git, GitHub
‚Ä¢	Tools: Visual Studio Code, XAMPP, MySQL Workbench

üöÄ What I Learned
‚Ä¢	Building a role-based authentication system in Node.js
‚Ä¢	Implementing secure CRUD operations connected to MySQL
‚Ä¢	Handling server-side validation and form data processing in Next.js
‚Ä¢	Structuring scalable, maintainable server-side web applications
